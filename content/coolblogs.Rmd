## Normalizing Flows and Deep Generative Models
- [Abdul Fatir Ansari](http://abdulfatir.com/) has some interesting blog posts on Normalizing Flows, the Reparametrization Trick and Monte Carlo Sampling. 
- [Brad Saund](https://www.bradsaund.com/) also has a very intuitive post on normalizing flows and also provides some code in Tensorflow 2.0.
- [Sean Robert Bittner](https://srbittner.github.io/) has some amazing context on normalizing flows and exponential family networks.
- [Emiel Hoogeboom](https://ehoogeboom.github.io/) has a great post on invertible convolutions with lots of diagrams.
- [Jonathan Gordon](https://gordonjo.github.io/) has detailed posts on Amortized VI, Few-shot learning and Deep probabilistic models in general.
