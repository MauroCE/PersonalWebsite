I will talk about the key algorithms used in ABC, some of the ideas surrounding simulator-based models, how to code them, and some of the most recent advancements in the field.

- Chapter 1 - **Foundations of ABC**
    - [What is ABC](/ramblings/approximate-bayesian-computation/01-what-is-abc): Introduces the problem of estimating the parameter posterior with an intractable likelihood.
    - [ABC Densities](/ramblings/approximate-bayesian-computation/02-abc-densities): Sets the notation and nomenclature for the rest of the course. I explore the ABC likelihood, the ABC posterior, the augmented ABC posterior and the kernel. 
    - [ABC Kernel and Summary Statistics](/ramblings/approximate-bayesian-computation/03-kernel-properties-summary-statistics): Building on the previous section, I motivate the usage of the Kernel and why it is a good idea. I also briefly mention summary statistics. 
- Chapter 2 - **Rejection and Importance Sampling ABC**
      - [Soft ABC](/ramblings/approximate-bayesian-computation/04-soft-abc): This is the first ABC algorithm in this set of notes. It resembles imporance sampling and sets the foundation for rejection ABC.
    - [Rejection ABC](/ramblings/approximate-bayesian-computation/05-rejection-abc): I frame Rejection ABC as a special case of Soft ABC with a uniform kernel. 
    - [Generalizations](/ramblings/approximate-bayesian-computation/06-generalizations): Generalize Soft-ABC to IS-ABC and Rejection-ABC to Rejection-Sampling-ABC.
- Chapter 3 - **Sampling Schemes for ABC**
    - [MCMC-ABC](/ramblings/approximate-bayesian-computation/07-mcmc-abc): Explores MCMC-ABC as a standard Metropolis-Hastings targeting the augmented ABC posterior and derives the pseudocode for it.
