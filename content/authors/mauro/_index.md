I am passionate about tackling environmental and healthcare issues using data. I am a final year Ph.D. student in Computational Statistics and Data Science (COMPASS) at the University of Bristol. My research initially focused on Generative models (VAEs, GANs, Normalizing Flows), whereas in the second part I have focused on Sampling algorithms. Specifically, I have developed the first bespoke sampler for Approximate Manifold Sampling.

My main research interests lie at the intersection of **scalable sampling** and **variational** methods with modern **neural density estimation** techniques, especially in the context of **likelihood-free inference**. I am also interested in the application of such methods to population genetics data. I co-run the Bristol [Neural Networks](https://neuralnetworksbristol.netlify.app/) reading group with [Pierre-Aur√©lien Gilliot](https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/persons/pierre-aurelien-m-a-gilliot). I also run the [COMPASS Seminar Series](https://compass.blogs.bristol.ac.uk/compass-seminar-series/) at the University of Bristol. Some of my `R` portfolios are available [here](https://statisticalcomputingportfolio.netlify.com/)
