Passionate about leveraging data to drive positive change, particularly in **tech-for-good** sectors such as democracy, AI safety (particularly (mis-)alignment and training dynamics), energy, and environmental sciences. Pioneered the first algorithm for efficient [Approximate Manifold Sampling](https://maurocamaraescudero.netlify.app/phd_thesis.pdf) and contributed to the development of [Integrator Snippets](https://github.com/MauroCE/IntegratorSnippets), with a focus on Simulator-Based Inference (SBI). Some random things I have organised: [Generative Models Reading Group](https://github.com/MauroCE/GMRG), [Neural Network Reading Group](https://neuralnetworksbristol.netlify.app/), [Bristol Online Charity Danceathon](https://epigram.org.uk/2020/07/24/bristol-dance-groups-host-charity-danceathon/), [Postgraduates in AI (PAI) Link](https://compass.blogs.bristol.ac.uk/events/pai-link/). Below, you can find my [**course on LLMs**](/#ramblings).

Other things I am passionate about include:

- Basketball :basketball: 
- Dancing (mostly Modern Jive, West Coast Swing and Blues) :dancer:
- Journalism, especially investigative (e.g. Bellingcat) :detective:
- Science of Cooking :test_tube: :shallow_pan_of_food:
- Exercising whether bodyweight, calisthenics or at the gym :weight_lifting:
