Passionate about leveraging data to drive positive change, particularly in **tech-for-good** sectors such as energy, environmental sciences, and healthcare. Specilized in scalable sampling, variational methods, and generative modelling. 
Pioneered the first algorithm for efficient **Approximate Manifold Sampling** and contributed to the development of **Markov Snippets**, with a focus on Simulator-Based Inference (SBI). In the past, I have organised:
