Taken from @EPWay. Assume that you can factorize your **target distribution** 
$$
f(\theta) \propto \prod_{k=0}^K f_k(\theta)
$$
Approximate target distribution using a distribution with a similar factorization, called the **global approximation**
$$
g(\theta) \propto \prod_{k=0}^K g_k(\theta)
$$
At each iteration of the algorithm, and for every factor $k=1, \ldots, K$ form the **cavity distribution** by removing $k^{\text{th}}$ term from the global approximation
$$
g_{-k} \propto \frac{g(\theta)}{g_k(\theta)}
$$
also form the **tilted distribution** by including $f_k(\theta)$ to the cavity distribution (in place of $g_k(\theta)$)
$$
g_{\backslash k}(\theta) \propto f_k(\theta) g_{-k}(\theta)
$$
The algorithm updates the site approximation $g_k(\theta)$ so that the new global approximation approximates the tilted distributiion
$$
g_k(\theta)^{\text{new}}g_{-k}(\theta) \approx f_k(\theta)g_{-k}(\theta)
$$
