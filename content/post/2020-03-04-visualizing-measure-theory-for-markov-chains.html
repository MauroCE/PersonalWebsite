<div id="sample-space" class="section level1">
<h1>Sample Space</h1>
<p>The sample space <span class="math inline">\(\Omega\)</span> is the <strong>set</strong> of all <strong>outcomes</strong> of our probabilistic experiment.</p>
<p><img src="/sample_space.png" alt="sample space" width="200"/></p>
<p>For instance:</p>
<ul>
<li>Experiment: A single toss of a coin.</li>
<li>Possible Outcomes: <span class="math inline">\(\omega_1 = \text{Head}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\omega_2 = \text{Tail}\)</span>.</li>
<li>Sample Space: <span class="math inline">\(\Omega := \{\omega_1, \omega_2\} = \{\text{Head}, \text{Tail}\}\)</span></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="event-space" class="section level1">
<h1>Event Space</h1>
<p>The event space is a <strong>sigma-algebra</strong> on the sample space. It is a subset of the power set of <span class="math inline">\(\Omega\)</span> whose elements, called <strong>events</strong>, satisfy some regularity conditions. When <span class="math inline">\(\Omega\)</span> is finite and discrete, the power set <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{P}(\Omega)\)</span> is a valid sigma algebra that can be used as the event space.</p>
<p><img src="/event_space.png" alt="event space" width="600"/></p>
<p>Practically <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{F}\subseteq \mathcal{P}(\Omega)\)</span> satisfying</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\Omega \in \mathcal{F}\)</span> The sample space is an event (called the “sure” event).</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(A\in \mathcal{F} \quad \implies \quad A^c\in\mathcal{F}\)</span> Closed under <strong>complementation</strong>.</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(A_1, A_2, \ldots\in\mathcal{F} \quad \implies \quad \cup_iA_i \in \mathcal{F}\)</span> Closed under <strong>countable unions</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>A pair <span class="math inline">\((\Omega, \mathcal{F})\)</span> of a set and its sigma algebra (in this case of the sample space and the event space) is called a <strong>measurable space</strong>. This is because we can define a function that “measures” the size of the elements of <strong>all</strong> the elements of <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{F}\)</span>. Indeed, any element of a sigma algebra <span class="math inline">\(B\in\mathcal{F}\)</span> is called a <strong>measurable</strong> set.</p>

<div id="probability-measure-and-probability-space" class="section level1">
<h1>Probability Measure and Probability Space</h1>
<p>After you’ve defined the sigma-algebra called Event Space, the next step is to define a <strong>probability space</strong>. A probability space is a triplet <span class="math inline">\((\Omega, \mathcal{F}, \mathbb{P})\)</span>, i.e. it is composed of three elements, two of which we already know.</p>
<ul>
<li>A sample space <span class="math inline">\(\Omega\)</span>.</li>
<li>An event space <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{F}\)</span> which is a sigma-algebra on <span class="math inline">\(\Omega\)</span>.</li>
<li>A <strong>probability measure</strong> <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{P}\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>A probability measure is a special case of a <strong>measure</strong>. Suppose you have a measurable space <span class="math inline">\((\Omega, \mathcal{F})\)</span> (also referred to as <span class="math inline">\(\Omega\times\mathcal{F})\)</span>). Then a function
<span class="math display">\[
\mathbb{P}: \mathcal{F} \to [0, +\infty)
\]</span>
is called a <strong>measure</strong> on <span class="math inline">\((\Omega, \mathcal{F})\)</span> if it gives a size of zero to the empty set and if it is countably additive:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{P}(\emptyset) = 0\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{P}\left(\bigcup_i A_i\right) = \sum_i \mathbb{P}(A_i) \qquad \text{for } A_i\in\mathcal{F}\)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Notice how the measure takes elements of <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{F}\)</span> and not elements of the sample space! That is, it maps <strong>events</strong> not outcomes. A probability measure is just a measure, as above, with the additional property that it maps to <span class="math inline">\([0, 1]\)</span> rather than to <span class="math inline">\([0, +\infty)\)</span>. In order words, it assigns probabilities to events, hence the name.</p>
<p><img src="/probability_space.png" alt="probability space" width="400"/></p>
<p>We can see in the diagram above how the probability measure maps the empty set to zero, the sample space to <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> and any other event to some number in <span class="math inline">\([0, 1]\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div id="random-variable" class="section level1">
<h1>Random Variable</h1>
<p>A random variable is also called a <strong>measurable function</strong>. Suppose you have two measurable spaces. One could be the pair of sample space and event space <span class="math inline">\((\Omega, \mathcal{F})\)</span>, and the other one could be some other arbitrary pair of a set and of its sigma algebra <span class="math inline">\((\mathsf{E}, \mathcal{E})\)</span>, although usually we choose <span class="math inline">\(\mathsf{E} = \mathbb{R}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{E} = \mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R})\)</span>. Then a measurable function is a function that maps elements in <span class="math inline">\(\Omega\)</span> to elements in <span class="math inline">\(\mathsf{E}\)</span> with some additional properties. Notice how this function maps outcomes to elements of <span class="math inline">\(\mathsf{E}\)</span>, it does not map events.</p>
<p>What property should this map satisfy? Imagine that we knew our sample space and event space, as in the coin tossing example. It might be a bit unhelpful to work on the actual sample space and event space, so instead we map them to alternative ones, that we are more comfortable using. For instance <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R})\)</span>. Then, it’s clear that we want our mapping to have a property that can guarantee us a sort of correspondence between the events in our original event space <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{F}\)</span> and our transformed event space <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{E}\)</span>. For this reason, we require our measureable function, or random variable
<span class="math display">\[
X: \Omega \to \mathsf{E}
\]</span>
to be such that the preimage <span class="math inline">\(X^{-1}(B)\)</span> of any <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{E}\)</span>-measurable set <span class="math inline">\(B\in\mathcal{E}\)</span> is a <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{F}\)</span>-measurable set.
<span class="math display">\[
X^{-1}(B) = \{\omega\in \Omega \, :\, X(\omega) \in B \} \in \mathcal{F} \qquad \forall \, B \in \mathcal{E}
\]</span></p>
<p><img src="/random_variable.png" alt="random variable" width="600"/></p>
<p>In the diagram above we can see how the set <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>, which is an element of <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{E}\)</span> has a pre-image, which we call <span class="math inline">\(X^{-1}(B)\)</span>, which is an element of <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{F}\)</span>!</p>
</div>
<div id="probability-distribution" class="section level1">
<h1>Probability Distribution</h1>
<p>A probability distribution is also called a <strong>pushforward measure</strong> of the probability measure <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{P}\)</span> via the random variable <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>. Suppose we have a probability space <span class="math inline">\((\Omega, \mathcal{F}, \mathbb{P})\)</span>. This means we can assign probabilities to events in <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{F}\)</span>. Now suppose we have a measurable spae <span class="math inline">\((\mathsf{E}, \mathcal{E})\)</span> but we don’t yet have a probability measure to measure events in it. How can we go about measuring sets in <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{E}\)</span>?</p>
<p>The key idea is that, given a set <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{E}\)</span>, we can use a random variable <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> to find the pre-image of such set in the event space <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{F}\)</span> and then measure this set via the probability measure <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{P}\)</span>. This will then be our probability measurament also for <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>, as shown in the figure below.</p>
<p><img src="/probability_distribution.png" alt="probability distribution" width="700"/></p>
<p>The probability distribution, or pushforward, is then denoted as <span class="math inline">\(X_*\mathbb{P}\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{P} \circ \X^{-1}\)</span>.</p>
