# Sample Space
The sample space $\Omega$ is the **set** of all **outcomes** of our probabilistic experiment.

For instance:

- Experiment: A single toss of a coin.
- Possible Outcomes: $\omega_1 = \text{Head}$ and $\omega_2 = \text{Tail}$.
- Sample Space: $\Omega := \{\omega_1, \omega_2\} = \{\text{Head}, \text{Tail}\}$

# Event Space
The event space is a **sigma-algebra** on the sample space. It is a subset of the power set of $\Omega$ whose elements, called **events**, satisfy some regularity conditions. When $\Omega$ is finite and discrete, the power set $\mathcal{P}(\Omega)$ is a valid sigma algebra that can be used as the event space.

Practically $\mathcal{F}\subseteq \mathcal{P}(\Omega)$ satisfying

- $\Omega \in \mathcal{F}$ The sample space is an event (called the "sure" event).
- $A\in \mathcal{F} \quad \implies \quad A^c\in\mathcal{F}$ Closed under **complementation**.
- $A_1, A_2, \ldots\in\mathcal{F} \quad \implies \quad \cup_iA_i \in \mathcal{F}$ Closed under **countable unions**.

# Probability Measure and Probability Space
After you've defined the sigma-algebra called Event Space, the next step is to define a **probability space**. A probability space is a triplet $(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, \mathbb{P})$, i.e. it is composed of three elements, two of which we already know.

- A sample space $\Omega$.
- An event space $\mathcal{F}$ which is a sigma-algebra on $\Omega$.
- A **probability measure** $\mathbb{P}$.

A probability measure is a special case of a **measure**. Suppose you have a measurable space $(\Omega, \mathcal{F})$ (also referred to as $\Omega\times\mathcal{F})$). Then a function 
$$
\mathbb{P}: \mathcal{F} \to [0, +\infty)
$$
is called a **measure** on $(\Omega, \mathcal{F})$ if it gives a size of zero to the empty set and if it is countably additive:

- $\mathbb{P}(\emptyset) = 0$
- $\mathbb{P}\left(\bigcup_i A_i\right) = \sum_i \mathbb{P}(A_i) \qquad \text{for } A_i\in\mathcal{F}$

Notice how the measure takes elements of $\mathcal{F}$ and not elements of the sample space! That is, it maps **events** not outcomes. A probability measure is just a measure, as above, with the additional property that it maps to $[0, 1]$ rather than to $[0, +\infty)$. In order words, it assigns probabilities to events, hence the name.
